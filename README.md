# 🎨 CSS Challenges (Course Projects)

This repository contains my **practice projects** from the course:

🎓 **[CSS Fundamentals](https://almdrasa.com/tracks/frontend/courses/css-fundamentals/)** offered by [Almdrasa](https://almdrasa.com)

By completing these challenges, I practiced the **core CSS concepts** while styling real mini-projects.  
This course is essential for building strong styling skills in **Frontend Development**.
